  recap: 'Jonah Heim solo-homered twice off All-Star Red Sox starting pitcher Tanner Houck and Jack Leiter notched a quality start, scattering 5 hits and a walk in 5 innings to get his first career win. LF Wyatt Langford made a nice run-saving catch in the 2nd and Leiter pitched out of trouble in the 3rd and 4th. Boston threatened in the 7th after Marc Church put 2 on, but Hoby Milner pitched out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam. 5 Ranger relievers combined for four shutout innings and Luke Jackson pitched a perfect 9th to get the save.

  recap: `Tyler Mahle couldn't find the plate in his first start of the season and didn't survive the 2nd inning as 31 of his 61 pitches were balls. But the Rangers led 2-1 after 2 innings when Red Sox LF Kristian Campbell made what appeared to be a diving catch of a Garcia line drive only to have the ball leave his glove when he hit the ground. The bullpen was excellent as 5 relievers kept the Rangers in the game and Adolis Garcia provided the offense with 3 RBIs on 2 doubles and a HR. The Rangers entered the 9th with a 4-3 lead. Arlington High School graduate Chris Martin pitched a perfect 9th for his first save of the season. Starting pitcher Walker Buehler took the loss for Boston.`

  recap: `Jacob DeGrom was sharp in his season debut pitching 5 scoreless innings and leaving with a 1-0 lead. Boston took a 2-1 lead in the 6th off reliever Shawn Armstrong on a looping double deep down the left field line and a throwing error by 3B Ezequiel Duran. Boston's rookie starter Richard Fitts had retired 12 straight entering the Rangers 6th. A 330-foot "wall-scraper" by Wyatt Langford down the RF line tied the game. 2 batters later Adolis Garcia homered 431-feet into the second deck in LF for what proved to be the game winner. Robert Garcia pitched a perfect 7th. Chris Martin stranded Alex Bregman at 3B in the 8th by striking out Kristian Campbell and Connor Wong. Luke Jackson allowed 2 baserunners in the 9th but struckout Alex Bregman with the tying run at 2B for his second save.`

  recap: `The Reds started the game against rookie Kumar Rocker with a single, HR, single, and double and this one was never in doubt: 6 runs on 7 hits and 2 walks against Rocker in 3 innings. The relievers fared no better, as Gerson Garabito gave up 8 runs, 4 of them earned, on 7 hits and 2 hit-batters in his 2 2/3 innings. Meanwhile the weak-hitting Rangers made Brady Singer, who was 9-13 last year on a good Royals team, look like a Cy Young candidate. He pitched 7 innings of 1-hit ball, striking out 8. The Rangers managed a pair of runs in the 9th on Jake Burger's 1st HR of the season. Adolis Garcia's batting average is .357 while the remainder of the team is hitting .195.`

  recap: `Nathan Eovaldi was brilliant, throwing a complete game 4-hit shutout, striking out 8 and walking none. Reds starting pitcher Carson Spiers was unimpressive in 2024 posting an ERA of 5.64 and an opponent batting avg of .297, but the Rangers lineup needed all of Eovaldi's excellence as Spiers and a trio of Reds relievers held them to a single run on 4 hits. The lone run came in the 1st inning on Wyatt Langford's 361-foot HR to LF, his 2nd of the season. Eovaldi retired Elly De La Cruz on a bouncing ball to 1B to end the game with the tying run at 2nd.`

  recap: `The pitching matchup featured Jack Leiter, who won his first start against the Red Sox, versus hard-throwing Reds ace and All-Star Hunter Greene. The Rangers managed a run off Greene in the 4th on a Joc Pederson single and a 2-out double by Josh Smith on a 100-mph fastball. Leiter was spectacular in his 5 innings, allowing just one hit, walking none, and striking out six. Bruce Bochy pulled Leiter before the 6th inning as a precaution due to a blister on his middle finger.
  Hunter Greene pitched 7 innings of 3-hit ball for the Reds, allowing the one run, walking 1, and striking out 8. Jacob Webb, Robert Garcia, Chris Martin, and Luke Jackson combined to shutout the Reds over the last 4 innings. For the first time in their history the Rangers have won back-to-back 1-0 games.`
